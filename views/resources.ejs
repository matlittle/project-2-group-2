              <h4>We think you may be suffering from Generalized Anxiety Disorder</h4>
              <br>
              <p>People with generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) experience excessive anxiety and worry, often about health,
                family, money, or work. This worrying goes on every day, possibly all day. It disrupts social activities
                and interferes with work, school, or family. GAD is diagnosed in adults when they experience at least three
                of the symptoms below on more days than not for at least six months; only one symptom is required in children.
                Symptoms of GAD include the following: restlessness or feeling keyed up or on edge being easily fatigued
                difficulty concentrating or mind going blank irritability muscle tension sleep disturbance (difficulty falling
                or staying asleep, or restless, unsatisfying sleep)</p>

              <br>
              <p>Diagnostic criteria for PTSD include a history of exposure to a traumatic event that meets specific stipulations
                and symptoms from each of four symptom clusters: intrusion, avoidance, negative alterations in cognitions
                and mood, and alterations in arousal and reactivity. The sixth criterion concerns duration of symptoms; the
                seventh assesses functioning; and, the eighth criterion clarifies symptoms as not attributable to a substance
                or co-occurring medical condition.</p>

              <h4>We think you may be suffering from Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder</h4>
              <br>
              <p>Adult attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is a mental health disorder that includes a combination
                of persistent problems, such as difficulty paying attention, hyperactivity and impulsive behavior. Adult
                ADHD can lead to unstable relationships, poor work or school performance, low self-esteem, and other problems.
                Though it's called adult ADHD, symptoms start in early childhood and continue into adulthood. In some cases,
                ADHD is not recognized or diagnosed until the person is an adult. Adult ADHD symptoms may not be as clear
                as ADHD symptoms in children. In adults, hyperactivity may decrease, but struggles with impulsiveness, restlessness
                and difficulty paying attention may continue.</p>

              <h4>We think you may be suffering from Major Depressive Disorder</h4>
              <br>
              <p>A mental health disorder characterized by persistently depressed mood or loss of interest in activities, causing
                significant impairment in daily life.</p>
              <br>
              <p>Possible causes include a combination of biological, psychological, and social sources of distress. Increasingly,
                research suggests these factors may cause changes in brain function, including altered activity of certain
                neural circuits in the brain. The persistent feeling of sadness or loss of interest that characterizes major
                depression can lead to a range of behavioral and physical symptoms. These may include changes in sleep, appetite,
                energy level, concentration, daily behavior, or self-esteem. Depression can also be associated with thoughts
                of suicide. The mainstay of treatment is usually medication, talk therapy, or a combination of the two. Increasingly,
                research suggests these treatments may normalize brain changes associated with depression.
